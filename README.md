# NodeJS MQTT

This is a simple API to read IOT Temperatures and send to a Mongo Database.

Later I'll add some routes to do some stuff on the IOT through a RN App.

The Iot stuff is already functional and communicating. Later I'll provide the C++ code.


### Halt

The MQTT library only works with _npm install_

### Steps 

Run to install related libs _npm i_

To compile you can use _npm start-server_
